# waterjug-dfs
A depth first search solution to the water-jug problem.

This simple program was developed as coursework for an AI module at Loughborough University. It was awarded 100% and has not been updated since submission (Nov 2020). The coursework has not been included to avoid copyright infringement.

The program is a depth first search solution to the water-jug problem, which the course formulated as follows:
There are 3 jugs that have capacities of A gallons, B gallons, and C gallons. A pump with an unlimited supply of water is available which can be used to fill the jugs. Water may be poured from one jug to another or to the ground. None of the jugs have measuring marks. In the start state, all the three jugs are empty. Find all unique states which can be reached given a choice of A, B, and C.
